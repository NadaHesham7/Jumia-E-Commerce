An Ecommerce Website ( a clone of Jumia ) 
This was a group project, done by three of my teammates and myself.

I worked on:
- The whole Product Details Page.
- Adding products to Cart 
- The whole Cart (Adding and deleting and counting..etc) 
- The whole My Account 
- what appears to logged in users and what appears to guests in the navbar
